# training-exercises

Repository containing training exercises from various resources such as books, website tutorials, etc.

## Structure

The structure of this repository is that each book/tutorial followed will be nested under an appropriately named folder.

Within each folder you can expect to find the scripts tackling the exercises, along with a short README doc further detailing the source of the exercises (i.e. book / tutorial resource).

To run the scripts found within each folder you can open the `package.json` file, find the command associated with the script you want to run, and trigger this via `npm run {command}`.
